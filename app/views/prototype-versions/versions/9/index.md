_**SUPERSEDED BY**_:<br>
[[Metadata Upload] Core journey & guidance](/prototype-version/13)

### Motivations & Context

This is primarily a technical prototype to help prove the concept of CSV upload technically and also further downstream of TDR.  

It doesn't currently take into account a lot of user needs and concerns from workshops and user research around the subject.


### Design changes

A linear happy path that starts at the point in TDR when a user's records are being checked (one screen on from file upload progress). 

Journey:

- Checking your records 
- Results of your record checks (modified)
- ðŸ†• How would you like to enter record metadata?
- ðŸ†• Upload a CSV with record metadata
- ðŸ†• Checking your metadata CSV 
- ðŸ†• Results of your CSV checks 
- [END]
