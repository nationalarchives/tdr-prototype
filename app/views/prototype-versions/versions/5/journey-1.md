A new ‘landing’ page is presented after the user has finished the upload journey successfully. 

All the user metadata actions are provided in one list at the bottom of the page. 

The copy at the top of the page will give a top-level summary of the metadata tasks. 

Drilling down into each item in the task list shows a page that gives a more detailed explanation of the task at hand.
