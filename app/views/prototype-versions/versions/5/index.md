### Motivations & Context

In the current designs, the extracted last modified date and the ability to provide a corrected date are accessible through the Descriptive Metadata section only.

The user will not necessarily know that the last modified dates are considered part of ‘descriptive metadata’. And with the current user journey (editing record metadata 1 by 1) the user must visit, for example, 5000 (x 2 or 3) pages to view and check and correct every date in a 5000 record consignment.

### Design changes

A new ‘landing’ page for metadata has been designed, with all the user metadata actions (dates, closure and descriptive) provided in one list at the bottom of the page.

Each of those actions leads to a new page that offers more information about the task at hand. This is intentionally slowing down the process so that crucial information can be delivered about the different types of metadata.
