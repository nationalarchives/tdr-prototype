_**THIS WORK HAS BEEN ADDED TO**_:<br>
[Composite of reviewed design work](/prototype-version/7)

### Motivations & Context

Providing accurate date metadata for transferred records is one of the most crucial and complex parts of the digital transfer process. 

Currently, the last date modified is inside the Descriptive Metadata section making it hard to find. It also needs to be accessed on a file-by-file basis making this an extremely labourious task.

### Design changes

- Many rows of LDMs are presented in a table so they can reviewed efficiently
- New page for adding a corrected date
- Language changes ('extracted' and 'corrected')
