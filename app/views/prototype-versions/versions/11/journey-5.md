The "results of your checks" page for CSV could be the place we offer a summary of uploaded metadata however this feature would also be useful for the manual entry journey. The current "Step 6 - Download and review" page is displayed for both manual and CSV journey. This is a natural place to ask users to review metadata for both journeys.

We therefore propose skipping the 'Results of your csv checks" page when there are no errors and going straight to this page.

This does not address the closure status confirmation and assumes that it will be on a separate subsequent page to this.
