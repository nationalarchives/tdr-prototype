### Motivations & Context

See the [design history](https://national-archives.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DA/pages/136675329/Sprint+93+-+User+wants+to+manipulate+metadata+for+a+large+volume+of+files#Changing-the-linear-model-of-TDR) for work on [TDR-2677 (User wants to manipulate data for a large volume of files (CSV experimentation))](https://national-archives.atlassian.net/browse/TDR-2677)

### Design Changes

The new work on the Task list follows the same model as the previous prototype. It includes updates to some tasks, task groupings and the individual linked pages. Some work has been done on the journeys between pages so that users don't need to always come back to the task list. The current idea is that at the end of each section the user will return to the task list.
