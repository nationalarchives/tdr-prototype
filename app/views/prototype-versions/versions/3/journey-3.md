This is a modification to the table so we only show the description. The other metadata _field names_ that are populated are shown in a vertical list.

We assume that description will be quite a common metadata field so perhaps the most vital one to show (assumption needs to be tested).

Because other fields will often be empty it will often be redundant to show them all in separate columns. Therefore showing which ones are populated allows the user to view the record to see the metadata.
