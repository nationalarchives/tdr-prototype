### Motivations & Context
This combines previous issues and design tasks:
- [TDR-3301](https://national-archives.atlassian.net/browse/TDR-3301) Resuming an in-progress transfer
- [TDR-3515](https://national-archives.atlassian.net/browse/TDR-3515TDR-3515) User needs to access last modified dates as separate sections to closure and descriptive metadata
- [TDR-3581](https://national-archives.atlassian.net/browse/TDR-3581) View and navigate many rows of metadata across many pages
- [TDR-3486](https://national-archives.atlassian.net/browse/TDR-3486) User needs to easily find and review last date modified
