- New design for metadata landing page ("Records metadata") including 3 sections
- Last date modified is it's own section
- Viewing all dates for records, including filtering/sorting/searching/pagination
- Closure and descriptive model changed so you can see all metadata in a summary table (uses the 'Add another thing' pattern)
