### Motivations & Context

This task follows on from [TUX-70](https://tdr-prototype.herokuapp.com/prototype-version/16). Based on user testing (Round 2, Dec 2024), prototype version 5 was created by Gareth Foote who subsequently left the organisation.

A new ticket was created [TUX-233](https://national-archives.atlassian.net/browse/TUX-233) to create a further iteration based upon further feedback from the editors, and slightly changed requirements. The goal is to create another version for testing, with a view to making another round of tweaks to the prototype and making those changes on the live site.

This prototype is intended for user testing.


### Design Changes

This is an iteration of the design done in TUX-70. There are no structural changes, mainly changes in component use and texts as well as creating unhappy paths.
