The user will be emailed by TDR when DTA logs into their admin area and marks that the transfer is in the state that requires amendment.

The user will be directed by email to either 'View transfers' or hopefully direct to the DTA Review page. They will receive a 2nd email direct from the DTA with guidance.

They may need to leave TDR again and work on the metadata corrections over some time. Therefore we also need to consider how the user returns to the transfer from the TDR homepage.
