The previous version required the combination of two pages into one. This meant a lot of information was introduced onto the 'Record metadata' page.

This version moves that information onto a separate guidance page (not shown in prototype).

New component introduced...the coloured inset, also called 'Alert' makes this important guidance information prominent and separate.

Ideally, encouraging new users to notice this and explore but also containing it so it can be skimmed over and ignored by more advanced users.

‚ùå Abandoned the idea of separate guidance pages for now. There would be too much dev and content design work.
