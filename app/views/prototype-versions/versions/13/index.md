### Motivations & Context

Designing the next iteration of the metadata upload. Intention is to make it relatively self-serving and support users in metadata entry and error correction.

### Design changes

Includes:
- ðŸ†• "Download a metadata template" page
- Update to "Results of your metadata checks" page. Includes error summary and downloadable report. 
- Update to the 'How do you want to enter metadata' page. Now called Record metadata with a bit of guidance. Essentially an introduction to the task at hand. 
- Update to "Upload a metadata CSV". Improved guidance. 
- Update to "Checking your metadata". Added information about what checks are happening.
- Removed steps because we're adding new pages and the steps are not coherent
- Created an 'attachment' component for both downloads mentioned above.
