- Guidance and download page:
	- Not clear that the template is specific to the users’ records- i.e. based on action they have just taken
	- The content in the guide is mixed (information and instructions)
- ‘I don’t need to enter any metadata’ page
	- download is no longer a template
	- Some key information which would be useful beforehand (i.e. the information needed to decide whether or not a user should provide metadata around description and language)
	- Check boxes confusing as can be interpreted as system done 
	- The information around ‘additional descriptions’ was the one that people struggled with the most)
	- Information around language needs re-thinking - only english and welsh
