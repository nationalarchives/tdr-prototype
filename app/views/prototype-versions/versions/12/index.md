HIS WORK HAS BEEN CONTINUED IN:  
[[Metadata Upload] Core journey & guidance](???)

### Motivations & Context

For those users who choose to upload metadata via a CSV, we found in user testing that they expect a template to improve the accuracy and speed of the process. We intend to provide that in an XLSX format that contains metadata field names as header columns. 

The download will be populated with intrinsic metadata and have blank columns for optional/additional metadata.

### Design changes

Version 1:   
Offering the download on the same page as the records success message. Allows users to download and review metadata (including file names/path) even if they aren't going down the CSV upload route

Version 2:  
The download metadata template page is separate and positioned after the choice is made to go down the CSV upload route. Has a bit more guidance than version 1. 

Removing 'Steps':
Removed the steps from each page title because we're continually adding more pages which affect the step count. Added section headers instead.
