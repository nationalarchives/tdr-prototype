### Motivations & Context

A significant number of judgment users are trying to transfer documents that we accept but are not original judgments. These include:

1. Updates to judgments
2. Press summaries
3. Other documents, such as court orders or sentencing remarks

We are willing accept types 1 and 2 from the list above (and they are currently sent through TDR), but it is necessary for the user to tell us what type of document they are transferring. This helps the editors to know how to act.

If it is type 3 (any other document) it should not go through TDR but can be emailed.

### Design Changes

We do not want to disrupt the journey for most users trying to transfer a judgment for the first time.

There will be a question and form input that will branch a user away from the most common journey toward a more complex set of questions. This question is complex and can be presented in various ways. We need to test the copy/content for this.
