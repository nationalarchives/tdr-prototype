**This work has been added to:<br>
 _[Resuming an in-progress review (Composite)]()_**

### Motivations & Context

Users need to view many rows each containing a record name, path and a selection of metadata. 

They need to view many simultaneously to review their progress or intrinsic/extracted metadata. They will also need to find specific individual records and potentially sort or filter by different criteria.

### Design changes

Adding multiple variations for testing including variations for:
* Sorting
* Filtering
* Search
* Pagination
